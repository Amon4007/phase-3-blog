# Database Management Without SQLAlchemy: A Developer's Guide

## Introduction
In the realm of Python programming, database management is a critical component for creating dynamic and data-driven applications. While SQLAlchemy is a popular choice for working with databases, developers sometimes opt for alternative approaches that provide more control and simplicity. This guide explores how to manage databases without using SQLAlchemy, leveraging Python's built-in tools like `sqlite3`. We will also showcase a practical example: a Python CLI application for managing a book inventory.

## Understanding Database Management

### The Role of Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs)
Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) like SQLAlchemy provide a layer of abstraction that simplifies database operations. They allow developers to interact with databases using Python objects rather than raw SQL queries.

### Why Avoid SQLAlchemy?
While SQLAlchemy offers robust features, it may not be suitable for all projects. Here are some reasons developers might avoid using it:
- **Simplicity**: For smaller projects, writing raw SQL queries can be more straightforward.
- **Learning Curve**: ORMs often have a steep learning curve.
- **Customization**: Direct SQL provides more control over database operations.

## Case Study: Building a Python CLI Application
Our example application is a Book Inventory system that uses Python's `sqlite3` module for database management. This CLI tool allows users to:
- Add and delete books.
- Manage authors.
- View all books and authors.

This approach provides hands-on experience with manual database operations.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Setting Up the Database
Using the `sqlite3` module, you can create a SQLite database and define tables directly with SQL commands. For example:

```python
import sqlite3

def create_tables():
    connection = sqlite3.connect('books.db')
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS authors (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
        )
    ''')

    cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            title TEXT NOT NULL,
            genre TEXT,
            author_id INTEGER,
            FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors (id)
        )
    ''')

    connection.commit()
    connection.close()
```

### Writing SQL Queries
Instead of relying on ORM methods, you write raw SQL queries. For instance, adding a new book:

```python
cursor.execute(
    'INSERT INTO books (title, genre, author_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
    (title, genre, author_id)
)
```

### Handling Relationships
With manual queries, you explicitly manage relationships, such as linking books to authors using foreign keys.

## Pros and Cons of Manual Database Management

### Benefits
- **Full Control**: Directly writing SQL allows fine-tuned database operations.
- **Simplicity for Small Projects**: Avoids the overhead of learning and configuring an ORM.

### Challenges
- **Increased Complexity**: As projects grow, managing raw SQL becomes cumbersome.
- **Error-Prone**: Manual handling increases the risk of mistakes.
- **Less Abstraction**: Requires understanding of SQL syntax and database design principles.

## Conclusion
Managing databases without SQLAlchemy is a viable approach for smaller projects or when you need fine-grained control over database operations. By understanding the trade-offs and leveraging tools like Python's `sqlite3` module, developers can build efficient and functional applications. However, for larger or more complex projects, the abstraction and features provided by ORMs like SQLAlchemy might be worth the investment.

This guide has provided a practical overview of manual database management. As you continue your development journey, consider your project's scope and requirements when deciding whether to use an ORM or raw SQL.
